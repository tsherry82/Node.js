creating an application that pulls from an API and displays the response through console.logs using Node.js

using a few APIS I am making a system that will pull the information and display it throught the terminal, I am finding it a little challenging working with the different responses with the different APIs (especially the spotify)

8/13 as of today I have the majority of the calls working but still trying to figure out the spotify one
I have am also working on cleaning up the response a bit so that it is not so cluttered and easy to read the information for the user.
